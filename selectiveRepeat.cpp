Program for selective repeat
Logic behind the program is the receiver and the sender both have the same window_size.
Meaning the sender can send packets in the number of window_size and the receiver can receive the same
If a single frame is dropped only that frame with the remaining frame is send and not the whole window as in case of go-back-n
Steps:
1.Get the no.of frames from the user
2.Get the window_size from the user
3.initialize the frame_count to zero and also no_tr(no of transactions) to zero 
4.Sender sends the packets whose acknowledgement is not received in batch size of window_size to the receiver and initialize sent_count by 1
5.If the receiver receives the frame it sends the acknowledgment
6.The packets whose acknowledgement is not received by the sender will be send back again with the remaining
  in the size of window_size and frame_count would be increased by 1 for each packet received
7.If frame_count is not equal to  frame_size jump to step 4
8.Print the sent_count
